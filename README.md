# Aishwerya Gahlot  
*Aerospace Engineer | PhD in Rotorcraft Aerodynamics*

Welcome to my academic and engineering portfolio. I am a PhD graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology with expertise in rotorcraft aerodynamics, adverse weather modeling, CFD, and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). I’m passionate about creating resilient aerial systems for complex flight environments, and I enjoy solving hard physics problems with elegant simulation tools.
